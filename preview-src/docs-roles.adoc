== Examples

=== Copying the data store of a database

You can use `neo4j-admin database copy` to copy the data store of a database, for example, `neo4j`.

. Stop the database named `neo4j`:
+
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
STOP DATABASE neo4j
----

. Copy the data store from `neo4j` to a new database called `database-copy`.
+
[TIP]
====
If you do not need an actual copy of the database, you can use the same values for `<fromDatabase>` and `<toDatabase>`.
The command replaces the original database with the newly created copy.
====
+
[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database copy neo4j database-copy
----
